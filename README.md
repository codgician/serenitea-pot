## Quick start

### Develop

Start developing with your own flavor of shell:

```bash
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

Don't have nix flake support? Try this instead:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Format the nix code:

```bash
nix fmt
```

To inspect evaluated values or do experiments, you may run REPL using:

```bash
nix develop .#repl
```
